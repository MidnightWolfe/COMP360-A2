# COMP360-A2

Kaiya: Sampled points from the Hilbert Curve for a spline. Created and generated a catmull rom looped spline from the points, generated a 2D image of the spline. Scaled / positioned 3D image version of the spline. Handled warnings, cleaned up code, added comments. Made google doc for debug info, the repo, and the Kanban board.

Markus: Created space-filling Hilbert curve function. Helped make a random selection of points for the spline to be generated.

Ryan: Created 3D image based off of 2D image of the spline that shows above the landscape. Created 3D path following the spline. Made a debug path. Added comments to the code for clarity.

Jannine: Created Path3D code to have plane object follow path and edited the overall code to be easier to read
