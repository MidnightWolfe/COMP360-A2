# COMP360-A2

Kaiya: Sampled points from the Hilbert Curve for a spline. Created and generated a catmull rom looped spline from the points, generated a 2D image of the spline. Scaled / positioned 3D image version of the spline. Handled warnings, debugged, cleaned up code, added comments. Made google doc for debug info, the repo, and the Kanban board.

Markus: Created space-filling Hilbert curve function. Helped make a random selection of points for the spline to be generated. Debugged camera to follow the plane without tilting. Helped make the tilt of the plane motion smooth rather than jerky.

Ryan: Created 3D image based off of 2D image of the spline that shows above the landscape. Created 3D path following the spline. Made a debug path. Added comments to the code for clarity.

Jannine: Created Path3D code to have plane object follow path and edited the overall code to be easier to read

Liam: Created / generated code for the plane to move along the spline and have the camera follow the plane. Created code to allow the plane to tilt based on the curves / corners of the spline. Commented for clarity.
